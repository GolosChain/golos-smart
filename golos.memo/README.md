# golos.memo

The `golos.memo` smart contract provides storage of user's memo keys. These keys can be used to encrypt transfers in the application. Currently, this contract does not allow a user to add or remove memo keys. It only provides storage of memo keys imported from the genesis, in case, they can be used in future. Currently, only abi file is used to store memo keys.
